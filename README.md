SmartVision – AI Assistive Sunglasses

SmartVision is an AI-powered assistive device designed to help visually impaired users navigate safely and independently.
These Bluetooth-connected smart sunglasses integrate dual 360° cameras, built-in speakers, and cloud-based AI services to provide real-time object detection, environmental awareness, and navigation guidance.

🚀 Overview

SmartVision combines AI, IoT, and accessibility technologies into a functional wearable prototype.
Using Gemini API for vision analysis, Google Maps API for route navigation, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) for voice feedback, the system offers a seamless and intuitive experience.

The glasses detect obstacles, recognize objects, and guide the user with spoken directions — improving safety, autonomy, and mobility.
